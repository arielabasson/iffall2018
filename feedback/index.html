	Feedback for Amanda
	<br>
		AESTHETIC
		<div> -Good design aesthetic, the images make sense with the quotes</div>
		<div> -There is also a good overarching theme for the aesthetic </div>
		<div> Make the name of the person saying the quote a different size from the rest of the quote </div>
		<div> Some of the alignment for the type is a little awkward (i.e. the horizontal Steven Universe)</div>
		<div>Make sure ragging is good</div>
		<div> Two of the images have the Cartoon Network logo in the corner, but one does not...I feel like this should be consistent</div>
	</br>
	<br>
		STRUCTURE
		<div> Overall, I think the visual properties are working well, but would you consider a very transparent overlay? This could create a little more contrast and dimension.</div>
		<div> The text on the vertical Amethyst quote is a little hard to read in combination with the image </div>
	</br>
	<br>
		TECHNICAL CHALLENGES
		<div> The image quality for the second set of post cards isn't great...can you find another higher quality image?</div>
